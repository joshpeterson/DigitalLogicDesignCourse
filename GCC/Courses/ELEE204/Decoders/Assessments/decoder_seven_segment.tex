Design the VHDL architecture for a 3-to-8 decoder with active high inputs and outputs that drives seven segment LED like the one in figure 6-44 of the text.  Assume that a given LED segment is on if its input is high.  The decoder should assume the input is a three bit binary number.  The decimal equivalent of that number will be shown on the LED display.  The decoder should use the following entity:
\begin{verbatim}
entity seven_segment_decoder is
    port (X: in std_logic_vector(2 downto 0);
          F: out std_logic_vector(6 downto 0));
end entity;
\end{verbatim}
I will provide a test bench that you should use to verify your architecture.  The testbench should run using your component without any errors.  Email your .vhd file before the beginning of class on the due date of the assignment.
