Given a state machine with 10 states:\\
(a) What is the minimum number of flip-flops required to fully implement the state memory for this state machine?\\
(b) Without knowing anything else about the state machine, how many flip-flops are required to allow the simplest excitation equations to be written?\\ \\

Solution: \\ \\
(a) At least 4 flip-flops are required, since they will provide $2^1=16$ states, where 3 flip-flops will provide on $2^3=8$ states.\\
(b) If we use one flip-flop to represent each state (10 flip-flops total), then the excitation equations will be very simple.\\
