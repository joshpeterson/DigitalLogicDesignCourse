A colleague shows you the following VHDL code, which does not work as expected.  Briefly describe the problem with this architecture.
\lstset{language=VHDL}
\begin{lstlisting}
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity inverter is
    port (X: in std_logic;
          F: out std_logic);
end entity;

architecture inverter_arch of inverter is
begin
    X <= not X;
    F <= X;
end inverter_arch;
\end{lstlisting}
