Using VHDL, write a four function calculcator (+, -, *, /) that operates on unsigned eight bit binary numbers.  Also, write a test bench (with proper \texttt{assert} statements) to verify that your calculator program works correctly.  Please email me your code by the beginning of class on the due date.  Hint: This assignment can be completed by creating only four enitities and one other function.  Do all of your math with integers.
